## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that is available on multiple platforms. The client requests that a game have the ability to have one or more teams involved. Each team involved will have multiple players assigned to it. Users must have the ability to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name, this is done through unique game and team names. The final requirement is that only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This will be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
While developing the documentation, I feel that my recommendations section was well done and thorough based off of the client's requirements. I made a case for an appropriate operating platform and described some of the architecture behind that operating platform. Other sections that were included are storage management, memory management, distributed systems and networks, as well as security.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of designing a UML diagram helped immensely when it came to developing the code. Using a UML diagram helps to maintain an overview of classes and methods to not get lost in the details while coding.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the evaluation section of my design document if I had the option to. I believe I could've provided more insight on the server side section of every platform mentioned.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted and implemented the user's needs by matching them as closely as possible with the technologies that were most appropriate and beneficial. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing so you avoid potential miscommunications that waste money and time for all parties involved.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by matching the user's needs with the positive benefits of a given technology. I would spend more time researching and gathering information in the future before making final decisions and evaluations. It's important to have proper and ample information when analyzing and designing a software application.
